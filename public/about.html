<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I view the world as an artist, think as a designer and execute as an athlete.</p>
<p>From my years of formal design education and work experience in the creative space, I have curated a holistic view of design. My team approach working with a number of international brands span across various industries including interior architecture, fashion, hospitality, advertising, graphic design, and illustration. My background as a nationally ranked competitive collegiate swimmer created my goal-driven personality. I built a smart and determined work ethic which I executed in the pool and studio. These athletic, work and life experiences continue to bring me around the world, constantly widening my perspective.</p>
<h3><p> Everyone has a story, I create the experience.</p></h3>
